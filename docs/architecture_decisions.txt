The message passing techniques we will be using:
   - REST 
   - gRPC
   - Kafka

- REST will be used to retrieve data from the database by the Person and Location services as it is a well established technology having wider adoption with a client-server property. 
	REST resquests have a stateless property thus each request has all the information necessary to process the request.

- gRPC server is deployed as a pod and receives data as protobuf messages to persist them into the database as it's fast by leveraging HTTP/2 for transporting data which is binary data thus making more efficient transfers using protocol buffers for structuring the data being transported. 
  Also, we don't need to worry about users adopting  gRPC as it is used internally between services

- Kafka has been deployed using bitnami helm chart. Two pods have been deployed: zookeeper and broker. 
  As there are too many people at large events, the app is expected to ingest plenty of locations, and identify people, which will produce a lot event messages, thus a message queue like Kafka will help in handling the load of messages. 
  It will help process the message in batches and avoid losing data.
